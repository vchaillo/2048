###Description

Le but de ce rush est de recoder le jeu 2048 en C pour un affichage console.

> 2048 is played on a simple gray 4 x 4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide smoothly
> when a player moves them using the four arrow keys. Every turn, a new tile will randomly
> appear in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4. Tiles slide as far as
> possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge
> of the grid. If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a
> tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided. The resulting tile cannot merge with
> another tile again in the same move. (source : Wikipedia)
